# Stress Prevention Dynamic Model
In this task we will work on the implementation of a domain model that describe stress, its cause and its effects. We will use the model to simulate the effects of stress.
From Task 1, we can see all the concept that are in involved in the model, and as asked, we will implement a total number of four rules that explain the phenomenon of stress, its causes and its effects.
#### Imports
Before we write the rules, we first import the Predicate class, just as we did for the others assignments.
Unzip the stress.zip
Continue with the imports:
#### Sorts
First of all, the sorts that are used in the model are defined as follows:
#### Predicates
Next, define the predicates file
#### Scenario
Thirdly, define the scenarios file
#### Rules
From here, you should implement a number of rules. The signatures of the rules are already given and it is up to you to implement the rest.

If you get stuck remember that there is an example notebook to draw inspiration from on how to format your rules.
#### Run
